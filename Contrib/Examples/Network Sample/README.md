This example shows the `URLSessionInstrumentation` in action. 
It only shows the minimum configuration: Just by initializing the class, all network request that happen after it will be captured by Opentelemetry as Spans. Check [`URLSessionInstrumentation` README](Sources/Instrumentation/URLSession/README.md) for more information.
