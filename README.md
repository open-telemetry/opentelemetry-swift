A swift [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) client

## Installation

This package includes several libraries. The `OpenTelemetryApi` library includes protocols and no-op implementations that comprise the OpenTelemetry API following the [specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification). The `OpenTelemetrySdk` library is the reference implementation of the API.

Libraries that produce telemetry data should only depend on `OpenTelemetryApi`, and defer the choice of the SDK to the application developer. Applications may depend on `OpenTelemetrySdk` or another package that implements the API.


#### Adding the dependency

opentelemetry-swift is designed for Swift 5. To depend on the  opentelemetry-swift package, you need to declare your dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift", from: "1.0.0"),
```

and to your application/library target, add `OpenTelemetryApi` or  `OpenTelemetrySdk`to your `dependencies`, e.g. like this:

```
.target(name: "ExampleTelemetryProducerApp", dependencies: ["OpenTelemetryApi"]),
```

or 

```
.target(name: "ExampleApp", dependencies: ["OpenTelemetrySdk"]),
```

## Documentation

Official documentation for the library can be found in the official opentelemetry [documentation  page](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/swift/), including:

 * Documentation about installation and [manual instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/swift/manual/)
    
* [Libraries](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/swift/libraries/) that provide automatic instrumentation

## Current status

### API and SDK

Tracing and Baggage should be considered stable

Metrics is implemented using an outdated spec, is fully functional but will change in the future

Logs are currently in development

### Supported exporters, importers and instrumentation libraries

#### Traces
* Exporters: Stdout, Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog and OpenTelemetry (OTLP) collector
* Importers: OpenTracingShim

#### Metrics 
* Exporters: Prometheus, Datadog, and OpenTelemetry (OTLP) collector
* Importers: SwiftMetricsShim

#### Instrumentation libraries
* URLSession
* NetworkStatus
* SDKResourceExtension
* SignPostIntegration


## Examples

The package includes some example projects with basic functionality:

- `Datadog Sample` -  Shows the Datadog exporter used with a Simple Exporter, showing how to configure for sending.
- `Logging Tracer` -  Simple api implementation of a Tracer that logs every api call
- `Network Tracer` -  Shows how to use the `URLSessionInstrumentation` instrumentation in your application 
- `Simple Exporter` - Shows the Jaeger an Stdout exporters in action using a MultiSpanExporter. Can be easily modified for other exporters
- `Prometheus Sample` - Shows the Prometheus exporter reporting metrics to a Prometheus instance
- `OTLP Exporter` - Shows the OTLP exporter reporting traces to Zipkin and metrics to a Prometheus via the otel-collector
