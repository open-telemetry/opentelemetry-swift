# opentelemetry-swift

A swift [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) client

## Installation

This package includes several libraries. The `OpenTelemetryApi` library includes protocols and no-op implementations that comprise the OpenTelemetry API following the [specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification). The `OpenTelemetrySdk` library is the reference implementation of the API.

Libraries that produce telemetry data should only depend on `OpenTelemetryApi`, and defer the choice of the SDK to the application developer. Applications may depend on `OpenTelemetrySdk` or another package that implements the API.

**Please note** that this library is currently in *alpha*, and shouldn't be used in production environments.

#### Adding the dependency

opentelemetry-swift is designed for Swift 5. To depend on the  opentelemetry-swift package, you need to declare your dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/undefinedlabs/opentelemetry-swift", from: "0.1.0"),
```

and to your application/library target, add `OpenTelemetryApi` or  `OpenTelemetrySdk`to your `dependencies`, e.g. like this:

```
.target(name: "ExampleTelemetryProducerApp", dependencies: ["OpenTelemetryApi"]),
```

or 

```
.target(name: "ExampleApp", dependencies: ["OpenTelemetrySdk"]),
```

## Current status

Currently Tracing, metrics and Correlation Context and  API's and SDK are implemented, also OpenTracing shims, for compatibility with existing Opentracing code.

Implemented a simple stdout, Jaeger, Zipkin  and OpenTelemetry collector for traces;

Implemented a Prometheus exporter for metrics.

## Examples

The package includes some example projects with basic functionality:

- `Logging Tracer` -  Simple api implementation of a Tracer that logs every api call
- `Simple Exporter` - Shows the Jaeger an Stdout exporters in action using a MultiSpanExporter
- `Prometheus Sample` - Shows the Prometheus exporter reporting metrics to a Prometheus instance
